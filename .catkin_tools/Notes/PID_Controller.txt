This will be flow control on how to use a Propotional Controller

Topics needed:
    Publbish linear and angular velocity to go to X , Y co-ordinates
    Get the current X , Y and Thetha (orientation)



void PerformProController(X,Y,Thetha,Goal#X, GoalY):

    # X , Y are Co-ordinates
    # Thetha is the orientation in 2D plane

    linearVeloConstant = 1.5;
    angularVeloConstant = 6;

    while distanceToCover > = theTolerance OR 0 :

        X_difference = GoalX - X;
        Y_difference = GoalY - Y;

        distanceToCover =  Pythagroas( (X_difference ) , (Y_difference) );

        linearVelocity = distanceToCover * linearVeloConstant;

        steeringAngle = atan2(Y_difference, X_difference )

        angularVelocity = angularVeloConstant * (steeringAngle - Thetha)

        # publish the linearVelocity and angularVelocity
